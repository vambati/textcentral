Otherwise willing to break up into smaller lots ...$30ppd for 3 ... which includes extra liners. Or MMAO. 9 small gPants - 2 blue, 2 red, 1 grey, 1 white, 1 purple, 1 green, 1 orange -8 purchased brand new 3 years ago and only used for about a month. Elastic sides are very stretchy and in great shape; no stains. Velcro is like new. -1 handed down to me used (red), it's an older style, velcro also in really great shape. Elastic very slightly relaxed but never caused issues for us. 10 extra liners -most are in EUC - plenty stretchy, snaps strong. One or two might have extremely faint staining around gussets - I tried to photo it but I can barely see it. One has very slight fraying at edge near snaps but usability is not impacted. 2 liners came with the older style diaper and are slightly more stretched out from being stuffed. 1 package of small disposable liners -I may have used 1 or two out of this package but it is pretty complete. Some I had pre-stuffed into the gPants and never used so they are perfectly clean and usable. These were basically washed by hand the majority of the time. Want to sell this lot ASAP please. Paypal only. Will ship quickly once payment received. SOLD- small gdiapers in EUC"
Negative	" all you do is criticise, you continually think you know it all and just insult. You seem to think only you know how things are possible and anyone else doesn't have any methods. Why post at all if your just 100% rude. I could say a good few things about you but have more respect for people ! Quote: : There was also some underlying b/s claim on the Amazon thread that he could open 5 bank accounts per day. Best way to withdraw stealth paypal funds"
Negative	 Amazon trumps Ebay all day long for selling used gear. The way their dispute process works is simply a lot more genuine without sellers being capable of normally pulling this sort of a stunt. Just be lucky he didn't ship you back a box of dog shit and Ebay/Paypal would still refund him the cash and you'll be out the lens. You'd best be praying that he isn't attempting to scam you as it's so incredibly easy to do using Ebay. Every now and then UPS/FEDEX/ETC are the ones to blame when they mistreat packages in transit. As much as I hate to say it neither of these companies take any care when handling packages. Either way you should completely avoid Ebay for selling high value items. It's a mine field at the best of times. A grumble about eBay and inexperienced shooters

not relevant	" Bronze Mayo Hole Ti scale for Spyderco Southard ADVERTISEMENT Bought this scale off ebay before I even owned the knife, but then ended up buying the knife already with a CF scale on it which I happen to like better. This is a titanium scale of approximately the same thickness as the stock one, with may holes drilled to match the skeletonizing on the liner (it even has the chatter marks around the holes like Mayo does). It has been heavily orange peeled, and then anodized a goldish bronze. I carried the knife with the scale on it for a few days and it is in 100% perfect condition. The hole placement and counterboring on the scale is absolutely perfect. Once screwed together, the knife functions perfectly. However, the scale is not so perfect when it comes to fit. It is a little proud of the liners, most noticeably in the cutout for the spydie hole. I'm sure someone with patience and sandpaper could easily fix that, but nevertheless I do not consider the scale perfect and willing to let it go for $75 .

A lot.  Technology has leapfrogged the banking sector, rendering it as obsolete as buggy whips. So why are we devoting 9% of our economy to an obsolete parasite?Financial sector profits now total a staggering 4.5% of GDP (gross domestic product), while the expenses generated by financial churning account for another 4.5% of the economy.  chart courtesy of Market Daily Briefing  Software and existing non-Wall Street/too-big-to-fail institutions could replace the entire Wall Street/banking sector and drop costs to .5% of GDP, saving us 8+% of our GDP ($1.25 trillion) that is currently siphoned off by parasitic middlemen. The banking sector is Exhibit A in the Middleman-Skimming Economy (February 11, 2014).  The pull of habit and propaganda is so strong that most people haven't even recognized that software and the Web can replace the entire financial/banking sector for a fraction of the cost of the current parasitic system, a system that (as we all know) has captured the regulatory and governance machinery of the central state, making a mockery of democracy.  The benefits of eliminating the financial/banking sector are immense and far-reaching.  What exactly do banks do? Banks perform these basic functions:  1. They hold depositors' money.  2. They act as a clearing house for payments, transferring funds from payor to payee.  3. They issue loans on a fractional reserve basis, i.e. a few dollars in cash deposits supports $100 in loans.  4. They originate and trade derivatives, run high-speed trading desks, operate various money-laundering and embezzlement schemes, influence elected officials with lobbying and campaign contributions and subvert both free market capitalism and democracy at every turn.  This entire parasitic middleman sector could be replaced with automated digital clearing houses and crowdfunded or non-bank loans. Why do we need banks to pay bills online? We don't; any clearing house could charge a small fee for the transaction.  Why do we need banks when loans can be crowdfunded? If we can invest money in start-ups via Kickstarter, Indiegogo, RocketHub, AngelList, etc., why can't we own a piece of someone's auto loan or home mortgage?  The web and software now enable the elimination of the entire middleman skimming operation of banking. Those with capital can invest that capital directly in loans that the investors choose. Risk is distributed throughout the system, and the process of verifying credit scores, income, valuations, assets, and so on--the building blocks of risk assessment and a market for debt and cash--can also be automated.  The entire notion that 100 savers put their money in a bank which then buys a mortgage with their savings and sells it as a security that supports a pyramid of derivatives is obsolete. Each saver can directly own (and sell on a transparent market) a piece of a mortgage, auto loan, business loan, etc. There is no need for a middleman banking sector at all--no skim, no concentration of risk, no opportunities for selling derivatives to unwary investors. All that goes away with the banking sector.  But what about holding deposits? We already have two institutions that could serve this role: credit unions and the post office. If those holding depositors' cash do not issue loans, they have no source of income to defray operating expenses. The solution is obvious: charge fees for holding deposits and payor-payee transactions.  If the fee structures are transparent, those who charge too much will disappear as customers go elsewhere. That's the purpose of transparent competition in an open marketplace.  Many other advanced nations have long combined postal and simple banking services: France and Japan come to mind. Here we have a postal service that is struggling to fund its operations in the era of email, and here we have millions of people who prefer to (or have to) do simple banking in person. There is no technical or administrative reason that the post office could not operate as it does in Japan, as a place to deposit funds (including auto-deposit of Social Security checks), take out cash, etc.  Please note that what I am suggesting is a transparent open market for these services provided by a range of enterprises and institutions. Assemble a marketplace of local credit unions, the post office, enterprises that handle payor-payee transactions such as Dwolla and PayPal, and you have a wide spectrum of choices to suit every need.  As for business loans: you can get small-business loans on PayPal right now. It's called Working Capital, and the borrower is given the total amount due right up front.  As for the commercial paper market: there is no technical reason why a transparent exchange couldn't enable borrowers and owners of capital to set short-term loan rates via transparent bidding with automated software.  The obsolescence of banking includes the Federal Reserve--the ultimate middleman skimming operation. But what about providing liquidity in credit panics? Well, to start with, once the banking sector is gone then the concentrations of risk and the obscuring of risk that go hand in hand with banking also disappear-- the forces that generate panics will have been dispersed. Those forces will have vanished along with the middleman financial sector that created all the risks, speculative excesses and panics. If there were a liquidity crisis, the Treasury could create and lend whatever funds were needed.  But what about manipulating interest rates and other forms of financial repression? Interest rates would be set by millions of borrowers and owners of capital in transparent transactions.  What about all those great investing services offered by big banks and Wall Street? As many have observed, automated index funds outperform 99% of fund managers over 10 year time frames. So Wall Street is also obsolete.  Once we get rid of these obsolete middleman parasites--Wall Street, the banking sector and the Federal Reserve--we have a delightful question to answer: what else can we do with the $1.25 trillion we'll save every year by eliminating these obsolete financial middleman parasites? A lot.   The Nearly Free University and The Emerging Economy: The Revolution in Higher Education...

Joined 2/2001Location: NJThumbs Up: 17I just bought 4 of the Lane 175 seats ( Brown leather bonded with power recline ) at a local furniture store. They look very similar to the Berkline 13175 seats pictured above. I paid $300 per seat plus $59 for white glove delivery of all 4 seats.Several years ago I was shopping for a new Tahoe. I visited several dealerships and a few of them claimed they couldn't drop the price any further because the price was only $100 over dealer cost. They even presented me with official looking documents showing the dealer cost to backup their claims.A few days later my brother informed me that one of his good buddies worked for GM in some type of corporate position overseeing several dealerships a few hours from where we lived. I told his buddy about the dealer prices I was quoted by the dealers and he said every one of em was full of baloney. Turns out the price the dealers claimed was barely above dealer cost was really going to net the dealer $10k in incentives, rebates etc from the manufacturer. Rather then pass along some of the savings the dealers lied about selling at dealer cost so they could ""break even"".Thankfully he was able to send me to a dealer willing to drop his price $8k below every other dealer I had visited. This only happened because I had inside info. Otherwise I would have believed the claims of dealer cost.  Subwoofer needed with floor standing speakers??

I came home to my parents house today to two letters from a company called Buchanan Clarke and Wells claiming that I owed paypal 401 euro and that I need to contact them (BC&W) to set up a payment plan. The letters looked ridiculous, with loads of made-up insignia and stuff. I just looked through my paypal history, and I haven't even put 401 quid through the account since I've had it, I usually just use it to pay for spotify. Who are these people?!

not relevant	" I am going to sell off some of the stuff from my TVS setup. This is the JLT Carbon Fiber 127 CAI. Some get the smaller ones confused but this is in fact the 127. I would be happy to educate those that would like to see the difference. Price is substantially higher on these intakes as well. This piece has a little less than 500 miles on it and is in excellent condition. We used it to do a little r&d and now time for the new setup so no need for it now. Comes with everthing as you buy it from JLT including the strut bar spacers that is sold with the kit. Pretty firm, these are not on here much or very long. Fits the 2010 up gt500 for sure... I was actually using this on my 2007 gt with a 4.6L 3v and 2013 GT500 TVS. I did have a cowl hood on my GT tho and it would not fit if I was using my 05-09 gt hood. This intake is designed for PD bowers with the CAI on the drivers side. $350 shipped to lower 48 us. Paypal fees are included ... please do not ""gift"" Thanks for looking SVT!

Positive	" I hate to be a stick in the mud, but they're right. If you use your Dad's PayPal for the transaction that's still illegal because you're underage. You would have to have an adult handle all of the transaction, from emails, to payment, to shipping, ect. Just making sure you know! Glad you're gung ho about it (and congrats on you making a tail!) but just don't go breaking the law. Selling a tail"
Negative	" I have an ecommerce store that sells vaporizers which are for aromatherapy use only. Paypal denied approval with the first application and I spoke with a Paypal rep regarding it. He seemed pretty confident we would be approved if we resubmitted and made our case about aromatherapy. He also said they would give some guidance on why we were not approved if denied a 2nd time. Well, we were denied again and received the same standard vague unapproval email which makes me wonder how we can get better support. I think they believe it is related to e-cigs. The truth is it is not in any way related to e-cigs. Google accepts business with aromatherapy and there are comprable ecommerce stores using Paypal. I am certain there is a way to get approved. We need some help getting past the hurddle. Thanks! Prohibited Item Issue: Aromatherapy"

It might very well be that the guilty part is my code although currently I have no idea why.Could you try changing screen resolution and/or monitor ?My environment is Win7 and I tested on a laptop (1366x768) and/or external monitor. I tried changing resolution and actually for me it works.May be we can continue exchanging by email if you wish (albertocasale@yahoo.com)Hello AlbertoAfter trying without any luck all sorts of screen resolution combinations in my Windows XP client and my Mac OS host environment, and also repeating them with and without my 1080p external monitor I noticed the 'Advanced' button in the Windows 'Display Properties' menu:Just by returning the DPI setting (in the 'Display' pane under the 'General' tab) from 'Large Fonts (120 DPI)' to 'Normal size (96DPI)' the stubborn cropping problem disappeared immediately!Now of course all text is much smaller. Anyhow, changing the DPI settings back and forth for the occasions that I need to use DMM is OK for me.Cheers, MartinPS: I think it would be good to have an updated 'known issues' list on the DMM download page in your Dropbox.Glad you solved the cropping problem and you're right about the ""known issues"", I'll add it to the manualFor the local path I tested succesfully withStorage_label://drive_name/path And Storage_name://drive_name_uuid/pathFor you it will bestorage_label://DuneHDD/Music Or storage_name://DuneHDD_397fc0652097044d/MusicMy Dune/DMM setup now functions like a Suisse watch!I got the local path to work with the web app by using Storage_name://drive_name_uuid/path.(Then I immediately removed the corresponding question from my post. Alas, you had already started to write your reply to it.)Anyhow, I read again the DMM Short User Manual pdf and the USING DMC ppt in order to see what constructive suggestions I could make regarding the documentation of the local path topic. These are:Another source of confusion to me has been that the 'Label' field gets automatically filled in with the default value 'Dune', but that is actually its SMB server name, not the label of my hard disk volume. I suggest that you either correct or remove this default value, or (as a quick fix) clarify on page 4 in the ppt that the default value assumes that the hard disk volume has the same name as the SMB server in the Dune.Last but not least I think it would be handier for the user if all the info from the ppt is merged into the pdf, maybe just as an annex at the end of the pdf file.Again, thank you for having created DMM, and being so dedicated to make it work for everybody.My best regards, MartinPS: Do you accept donations for you efforts? If yes, please let us know where to send them...You can donate from within the program using paypal as I didIts not in english but easy to follow if you use paypal normally.It is also in euros but paypal convertsI used currency converter so I knew in my currency what to sendHello again, AlbertoMy Dune/DMM setup now functions like a Suisse watch!I am new at DMM, but so far I have been enjoying it.Not with the current version, I'm afraidI'm developing v2.0 which will allow you, with the PC application, tocreate playlists to be seen/used on TV and WebAppcreate collections of albums to have easy access to a subset of your library (each collection creates also a playlist with all its songs)I also plan to extend the capabilities of the webapp to allow the user to dynamically create and manage a playlist by browsing the library and do something like Play, Play Next, Append. Need to check the feasibility and reliability of this but I think it is doable.Would you be doing like dune explorer where you could have the name of the cd under the cover of the cd.Location: Salida, Colorado Thumbs Up: 11I'm having an issue that I believe is caused by having some albums that are Sountracks with various artists. I have a folder called Various and it has subfolders for each album. eg. Music\Various\Last Action Herocould you send by email (albertocasale@yahoo.com) the following pieces of infothe dune_folder.txt file in the exported menu corresponding to Last Action Hero (it is in the Albums folder)the m3u file corresponding to the album Last Action Herothat is in the folder .DMMplaylists (under your \Music library folder, the file starts with album_)the .txt file corresponding to your menu that is insideQuote:Originally Posted by otreblaelasac That's nice to hear !Thanks to Denass I realise the PayPal Donate link points to a french version. If it is a problem I can provide an english version.Curiously I hadn't even noticed the Donate button. I was looking for donation info under Actions because it's the main menu of DMM.(Since I am a little bit old-oldfashioned I suggest that you add something like 'About DMM' at the bottom of the 'Actions' drop down list, and there include links to PayPal, this forum and the DMM download directory.)Regarding the language versions of PayPal I have noticed different behaviours with different browsers. I don't remember which but at least one of them displays an language selector in the upper right corner. With other browsers the language will change when you select your country, but that selector only appears after you have filled in the total amount of the donation. And if you choose to log in to your PayPal account (if you have one) then the language will default to the country of your account.The neatest solution would probably be to have the PayPay link point to the language version that corresponds to the currently active user interface language.Location: Salida, Colorado Thumbs Up: 11After using the DMM Web app for a few weeks, I have just 3 things I would like to see added.1) The ability to queue up songs as they are playing. This one has been mentioned before but it's still number 1 on my wish list. 2) Next and Back page buttons on the Artists and Albums screens. This is really only for when I use it on my PC during the day.3) This one is just nit picking, but I wish the songs were already visible after selecting an album instead of having to click or tap the + to show them. 1) yes I plan to add to the webapp the capability to manage playlists on the fly. I hope to be able to fully implement it2) actually using firefox or chrome on windows 7 (haven't tested with other combinations) I can ""swipe"" by keeping the mouse left button pressed and swipe left or right 2) actually using firefox or chrome on windows 7 (haven't tested with other combinations) I can ""swipe"" by keeping the mouse left button pressed and swipe left or rightAlbertoI have tried with IE 11 and Chrome on Windows 7, but I can't get to the next page.

not relevant	" Not sure what you are trying to do but if you just want inserts MRRC appears to let you order on their site and they accept PayPal. I'm assuming they back out the VAT since it's a US sale. The issue is that available inserts do not necessarily fit all wheels, MRRC inserts come in two sizes and are not a good fit with other wheels other than MRRC without some work... also an issue with D'Arts unless you are using their rims which a fabulous product line. I am making the assumption that if it's a ""build"" you will have some good aluminum rims on it. There are a lot of peeps casting inserts out there so perhaps you may get a lead on someone casting inserts for common wheels such as Slot It. You will get better advice with more information about the project I think. 904 wheel inserts"

Positive	" Oh yes there is! I filed BK in 2006 and I have not been late on a thing since (and never carry a balance). I have Chase Marriott & SWA (10k), CaptialOne Venture (10k), Barclaycard (10k), Amex Platinum, minor cards are Target, Kohl's, NewEgg, PayPal BillMe Later, GE Medical. My two chase cards I got a little over a year ago but had to call in to them when I got the online decline (since then they have been GREAT to me on my CL). CaptialOne was my first subprime card (World Card I think it was) but was upgraded to Venture after 4 years ago after calling into them. They also raised my limit from 4k to 10k on a call too - it took a few phone transfers but they did it on my history only and did not even hard pull my scores! Oh, I have a HSBC Card (10k) but I pretty much hate that card (along with my Barclaycard) - but I guess it is really a CaptialOne card now. Just last Saturday I was approved for my Amex Platinum card - after many tries. This was my ""gold ring"" to get back into the Amex door (since I burned them for ~4k on my BK). They even backdated my membership to 1996 - which I find amazing. TU (from Barclaycard site): 731, EX: 738, EQ: 701 Is there life after BK?"

The group of four companies, led by eForCity, tried to have the lawsuit dismissed on procedural grounds, but US District Judge Jeremy Fogel has ordered the lawsuit to proceed. In July, Apple sued a group of seven companies that make and/or sell unauthorized accessories designed to work with its various iDevices. Apple has a specific licensing and certification program for businesses that want to offer such accessories, known as the MFi Program . To avoid paying the licensing fees, the seven companies skirted the program and made accessories without Apple's blessing. Apple claimed that by doing so, the companies are culpable for patent infringement-as the company has numerous patents on its 30-pin dock connector and cable-as well as trademark infringement and unfair competition.

Negative	" Originally Posted by DavidS7 Hello, for a while I've launched my website using the eCommerce Magento, but I am currently migrating to OpenCart since it is easier to use. But before going forward, and make another mistake, I need your help: I've never been satisfied with my website: www.techmake.com - I need eCommerce (shopping cart, catalog, statistics, etc.) but I also need to create content, with something easy to use such as WYSIWYG. - I also want to integrate a Forum, and the login and password of the shopping cart is the same as the forum. - Integrate a blog - etc. Can anyone advice me what should I use? Thank you. I played around with OpenCart last year but dropped it to concentrate on other things. I do remember being able to customise the stylesheet fairly easily and tweaking it a lot. I stuck with basic template. I would be interested in knowing how to set up a commerce system on a local virtual server like WAMP, or anything that simulate the database. I was having to make my OpenCart tweaks live on a test subdomain. I didn't get very far unfortunately because I was only poking around with a checkout system by request of a client for whom I'd already built a website. My bigger challenge was integrating a merchant account, SSL and a payment processor that was ANYTHING but PayPal. The OpenCart community publish a fair few plugins but I remember their forums ( http://forum.opencart.com ) containing lively discussions about which plugins were broken and which were working. Always useful to read that stuff first. The other thing with OpenCart was I never knew how to make it responsive, and as for the blog - I never made it that far! LOL I am now smitten with WordPress so I'll probably be looking to use StudioPress plugins to tackle any commerce system challenges. I'm pretty sure OpenCart is open source and free but if I HAD to use it, I would be looking for a premium version of the software and pay gladly. If there are good developers that can help you, please keep us informed on this thread! I would appreciate knowing your experiences and seeing how we can share tips, advice etc. Edit: Here are some screencast videos by OpenCar t. I seem to remember following these and finding them helpful CMS and eCommerce together?"

The box shows some shelf wear (see pics). I've never removed the knife from the sealed plastic bag (not even to take the pictures below). Price: SOLD Benchmade 556 Mini-Griptilian MDP is new in the box. Because the knife came in an open ended plastic bag, I removed it to take the pictures below. Price: $75.00 Both knives come with the original boxes and any papers, cloth bags, etc that were in the box when I bought them. The Air was bought online from a knife shop and the Mini-Griptilian was bought from a local gun shop. I have not carried either knife. I'm selling these two knives to pay for a Spyderco Kopa. I only accept payment through PayPal and only ship to the United States. I cover PayPal fees and shipping (with tracking). If for any reason the knife is not what you were expecting, return it to me (at your cost) within 7 days after receiving the knife and, upon receiving the knife back, I will refund the full price you paid for the knife. This is the first time I've sold knives on the forum = going through all the steps for the first time. If I've missed some information you need, please let this newbie know. Oops - just learned I can only post 5 images in a single post, so I'll attach the spydie pics here and the benchmade pics in a second post (hopefully I can do that). Thanks for taking a look.

spam	" Stevanovich/ShutterstockAs she paged through Viking River Cruises' glossy brochure one recent afternoon, Diane Moskal noticed a new way to save money: If she booked the Waterways of the Tsars itinerary sailing from Moscow to St. Petersburg with something called an e-check, the cruise line promised to knock $100 off the fare.An e-check is an electronic debit to your checking account, and it's billed as a quick, convenient way to pay for your vacation that is ""as easy as providing your credit card number,"" according to Viking.But like any smart traveler, Moskal wasn't content with that explanation. ""I see that the cruise lines advocate consumer savings if you pay by e-check,"" she says. But she also found several complaints online, which made her hesitate. She wondered: Are e-checks safe?As airlines, hotels and cruise lines offer new ways to pay for their products, Moskal's question resonates across the entire travel industry. On several airlines, including American, Southwest and United, you can book a ticket through PayPal. Virgin Galactic made a splash late last year when it announced that it would accept Bitcoin for its spaceflights. One hostel in San Francisco, the Pacific Tradewinds, famously offers a 30 percent discount to guests who pay with the digital currency.While Viking River's e-check option isn't new - it's been available since 2008 - the concerns raised by Moskal and others are. It turns out that there are several important differences between paying by e-check and paying by credit card. And given the popularity of new electronic payment choices, it's a good time to understand how they work.Americans made 22.1 billion electronic payments using options such as e-checks in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers are available, according to a recent Federal Reserve study. The number of transactions grew at an annual rate of 5.1 percent from 2009 to 2012, the Fed reports. By comparison, consumers conducted 26.2 billion credit card transactions in 2012, and those numbers grew at a somewhat faster 7.6 percent annual rate.The benefits to companies are obvious: They avoid paying any fees associated with credit cards and they receive the customer's money right away, deposited directly into their merchant bank. But consumers have an advantage, too, at least according to companies like Viking.""Guests who pay via e-check receive a discount of two percent, which reflects a savings that Viking passes on to the guest by not having to pay a fee to a credit card company,"" says Viking spokesman Ian Jeffries. He says that the company also recommends payment via e-check as an alternative to a credit card so that you can avoid any interest rates or fees that some credit card companies may charge.Viking is hardly alone. One recent study found that a quarter of airlines worldwide offer some form of alternative electronic payment option. As companies try to escape the high merchant fees charged by credit cards, these payment choices are bound to become more common in the near future.""Conventionally, the discounted pay-by-e-check transactions are processed through the traveler's bank, given the customer's bank routing numbers and checking or savings account numbers,"" says Oliver McGee, a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of transportation for technology policy and a professor at Howard University.E-checks come in two basic flavors: Check21 electronic payment processing, which is more flexible but also more expensive, and the more restricted ACH wire deposit payments, which are commonly used for handling direct deposits for employees and for paying bills.As a practical matter, setting up an e-check involves giving the travel company basic bank information, typically gained through the bank's routing numbers, as well as your account number, and authorizing the transaction.But you also sacrifice something when you're paying with an e-check. As with paper checks, once the money is deposited into the company's account, your ability to reverse the charges is limited. Your right to dispute an e-check travel purchase is governed by either the ACH or Check21 terms and conditions as well as the electronic fraud protection conditions of your financial institution.By comparison, a credit card purchase is protected by federal law under the Fair Credit Billing Act, which, among other things, lets you dispute charges for products you didn't accept or that weren't delivered as agreed, and which can quickly fix a billing error.""You have more leeway to dispute a purchase made with a credit card,"" says David Bakke, who edits the personal finance Web siteMoney Crashers .If an e-check booking goes wrong - say, for example, that your cruise line files for bankruptcy protection and you want a refund - you may lose your money. Bakke says that e-checks can be reversed in only three cases: if you didn't authorize the purchase, if the e-check was processed on a date earlier than authorized or if the amount of the processed transaction is different from what was authorized. Otherwise, the money is as good as gone.While complaints about e-checks are rare, grievances with companies over wired money appear to be increasingly common. Not a week seems to go by that someone doesn't ask me to help retrieve money that had been wired to a company or an individual. These transactions are difficult, if not impossible, to undo.

Your right to dispute an e-check travel purchase is governed by either the ACH or Check21 terms and conditions as well as the electronic fraud protection conditions of your financial institution.By comparison, a credit card purchase is protected by federal law under the Fair Credit Billing Act, which, among other things, lets you dispute charges for products you didn't accept or that weren't delivered as agreed, and which can quickly fix a billing error.""You have more leeway to dispute a purchase made with a credit card,"" says David Bakke, who edits the personal finance Web siteMoney Crashers .If an e-check booking goes wrong - say, for example, that your cruise line files for bankruptcy protection and you want a refund - you may lose your money. Bakke says that e-checks can be reversed in only three cases: if you didn't authorize the purchase, if the e-check was processed on a date earlier than authorized or if the amount of the processed transaction is different from what was authorized. Otherwise, the money is as good as gone.While complaints about e-checks are rare, grievances with companies over wired money appear to be increasingly common. Not a week seems to go by that someone doesn't ask me to help retrieve money that had been wired to a company or an individual. These transactions are difficult, if not impossible, to undo. Generally, if you're dealing with a small local company or an individual, you can kiss the cash goodbye. After I explained the differences in payment methods to Moskal, she consulted her travel agent, who booked her on the Viking riverboat cruise to Russia this fall. ""She never raised the question of paying by anything other than credit card,"" says Moskal.If you're having trouble with a business - any business - and you've reached a dead end, maybe we can help.

I know they have an area that they want you post what you are buying, and they get a percentage. I would bet that that's identical to what they use. Facebook, Amazon, and a lot of other sites have links to go buy stuff. I guess that's how they're making more/extra money.

Negative	" Travel TechURGENT alternative to skype, for tabletI'm having a nightmare (airline/tripsta took my money but lost my booking so I'm stranded) and need to make lots of international calls.Skype have 'improved' their service again by routing any attempt to buy credit through a partner company in Taiwan, because that's where I was when I opened my account. I don't live there and don't have a Taiwan bank account, so can't use it. I tried opening a new account in New Zealand, but the 'buy credit' button takes me to a blank page. And my girlfriemd's Indonesian account doesn't even include an option to buy credit. So I need another oprion.I tried Tablet Calling app, but paypal tell me they can't process payments to that company. No reason why! I checked and I do have money in paypal, which is the only payment option they offer.What can I install that will allow me to add credit from either paypal or visa card, to make voice calls worldwide?I'm on an Acer Iconia tablet running Android, and also have a cheap Samsung Android phone.  3I ended up just buying a calling card, and asking Tripsta to call me back.Does Google talk allow you to call phone numbers? They make everything so complicated, I don't even know what their service can or can't do. Still looking for an alternative in the long term. Skype customer service told me that as far as they're concerned I am Taiwanese and have to use Taiwan payment systems, which incidentally are only available to Taiwan citizens. Even if I still lived there, I couldn't use their service any more.If a global business can't understand that people move around, it's not really useful for me. Does anyone know of any great services ( of any kind) that don't pigeonhole you because of where you happen to be on that day?  4I found the only ""solution"" to be making sure the account is amply loaded with money before heading out on a trip. You simply can not count on being able to credit more funds to an existing account, or set up a new account with a new provider, while you're on the road. I think this applies no matter who you use.  5difficult to get access to my own phone unless I have my own lodge or hotel etc. but still check if hte hotel charge locally some do. calling cards used in public phones are quite expensive so I just use a simcard or just pay and use their phones in the hotel for these unexpected stuff it cost more but at least it gets the job done. if it was just chatting to people I know myself I juse apps like WeChat, WhatsApp etc ... no need to get their Skype ID you just need their phone number provided you have Internet access.  http://www.magicjack.com for years, and I travel a lot. It gives you a USA or Canada phone number and lets you call any number in the US and Canada for  8An alternative to Skype, in terms of video chatting features could be ooVoo. Video calls are extremely simple to set up and conferences can hold up to 12 participants. For the times you don't need video, you can instant message.ooVoo supports calling to phones but you'll need to purchase ooVoo credits first which is very straightforward.

Who is Behind the Very Generous 'Tips for Jesus'?Thanks to DT.By Alastair Leithead, BBC News, Los Angeles - February 21, 2014http://tinyurl.com/m9kczutA secretive syndicate of super-rich diners have started a trend of leaving lottery-winning tips for bar staff, waiters and waitresses across the US. The lucky recipients are thrilled at the windfall, but is this another sign of the growing chasm between the rich and everyone else in America?Scribbling the phrase ""Tips for Jesus"" alongside outrageous gratuities on credit card receipts, the trend - presumably among the super-rich - has set the internet abuzz with speculation over who the ringleader might be.More than $130,000 (å£78,027) worth of tips are said to have been left in the six months since the mystery handouts began.Pictures of many grinning faces and evidence of their windfalls have been posted on Twitter and Instagram, where #TipsForJesus is not only trending but is unsurprisingly attracting a lot of ""likes"".The movement we started is intended to be agnostic""- Unnamed,""Tips for Jesus"" ringleaderUndercover benefactorsThe rich and mysterious tipper or group of tippers have been leaving giant gratuities in a dozen cities across the US and Mexico, but recently the service staff of Los Angeles have been cashing in.Just last week a waiter at a top Italian restaurant in LA picked up a $6,000 gratuity on a $900 dinner bill, and a fast food server was given a $100 for a $4 milkshake.Two waitresses at an iconic Sunset Boulevard strip club, Jumbo's Clown Room, shared $2,000 in tips on a $272 bill.But the undercover benefactors have also been operating in New York, Arizona, San Francisco and Palo Alto, and it's there where many people think the secret to the lavish spending lies - a Silicon Valley billionaire. Some insider magazines have gone as far as to name former PayPal vice-president Jack Selby as the mystery money man, but he's keeping quiet and those responsible remain out of the public eye.And apparently ""Tips for Jesus"" has nothing to do with religion.Widening wealth gapThe ringleader asked to keep his anonymity in exchange for an interview with the San Francisco Magazine. ""The movement we started is intended to be agnostic,"" he is quoted as saying, suggesting he can't remember exactly how it all began, other than it being last September after a college football game in Michigan.A $3,000 tip on an $87.98 tab, with a photograph posted to Instagram, and ever since then a flurry of local media interest has followed news of the latest big gratuity.The ringleader has ""been fortunate"" in life, the magazine says, adding he and his friends had been big tippers for years - just not this big. Rubber stamps have even been made, and there's a possibility copy-cat tipping is going on - something welcomed by those lucky enough to share in the peculiar redistribution of wealth.Tipping is part of culture in the US, where there are traditionally low wages for serving staff, but this is a curious form of luck-based philanthropy.This is the Council of Love meditation to guide you in anchoring your sacred self in the Divine Mother's Tsunami of Love.

We can choose to make our love for the world be what our lives are really about. Each of us now has the opportunity, the privilege, to make a difference in creating a world that works for all of us.

They are legit, i got my kit today and it looks nice. I have an issue with no audio but i am guessing that my head unit may not like the factory amp. I have another thread started asking for help if anyone knows what might be wrong. If I can't figure it out, i will probably just loose the amp and factory sub and wire directly to head unit.
