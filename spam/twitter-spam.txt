Kindle for PCKindle for MacKindle for iPhoneKindle for iPadKindle for Androidgive a Kindle ebook as a giftOur print books:The Nearly Free University and the Emerging Economy ($20)  Banks Are Obsolete: The Entire Parasitic Sector Can Be Eliminated ~  What else can we do with the $1.25 trillion we'll save by eliminating these obsolete financial middleman parasites? A lot.  Technology has leapfrogged the banking sector, rendering it as obsolete as buggy whips. So why are we devoting 9% of our economy to an obsolete parasite?Financial sector profits now total a staggering 4.5% of GDP (gross domestic product), while the expenses generated by financial churning account for another 4.5% of the economy.  chart courtesy of Market Daily Briefing  Software and existing non-Wall Street/too-big-to-fail institutions could replace the entire Wall Street/banking sector and drop costs to .5% of GDP, saving us 8+% of our GDP ($1.25 trillion) that is currently siphoned off by parasitic middlemen. The banking sector is Exhibit A in the Middleman-Skimming Economy (February 11, 2014).  The pull of habit and propaganda is so strong that most people haven't even recognized that software and the Web can replace the entire financial/banking sector for a fraction of the cost of the current parasitic system, a system that (as we all know) has captured the regulatory and governance machinery of the central state, making a mockery of democracy.  The benefits of eliminating the financial/banking sector are immense and far-reaching.  What exactly do banks do? Banks perform these basic functions:  1. They hold depositors' money.  2. They act as a clearing house for payments, transferring funds from payor to payee.  3. They issue loans on a fractional reserve basis, i.e. a few dollars in cash deposits supports $100 in loans.  4. They originate and trade derivatives, run high-speed trading desks, operate various money-laundering and embezzlement schemes, influence elected officials with lobbying and campaign contributions and subvert both free market capitalism and democracy at every turn.  This entire parasitic middleman sector could be replaced with automated digital clearing houses and crowdfunded or non-bank loans. Why do we need banks to pay bills online? We don't; any clearing house could charge a small fee for the transaction.  Why do we need banks when loans can be crowdfunded? If we can invest money in start-ups via Kickstarter, Indiegogo, RocketHub, AngelList, etc., why can't we own a piece of someone's auto loan or home mortgage?  The web and software now enable the elimination of the entire middleman skimming operation of banking. Those with capital can invest that capital directly in loans that the investors choose. Risk is distributed throughout the system, and the process of verifying credit scores, income, valuations, assets, and so on--the building blocks of risk assessment and a market for debt and cash--can also be automated.  The entire notion that 100 savers put their money in a bank which then buys a mortgage with their savings and sells it as a security that supports a pyramid of derivatives is obsolete. Each saver can directly own (and sell on a transparent market) a piece of a mortgage, auto loan, business loan, etc. There is no need for a middleman banking sector at all--no skim, no concentration of risk, no opportunities for selling derivatives to unwary investors. All that goes away with the banking sector.  But what about holding deposits? We already have two institutions that could serve this role: credit unions and the post office. If those holding depositors' cash do not issue loans, they have no source of income to defray operating expenses. The solution is obvious: charge fees for holding deposits and payor-payee transactions.  If the fee structures are transparent, those who charge too much will disappear as customers go elsewhere. That's the purpose of transparent competition in an open marketplace.  Many other advanced nations have long combined postal and simple banking services: France and Japan come to mind. Here we have a postal service that is struggling to fund its operations in the era of email, and here we have millions of people who prefer to (or have to) do simple banking in person. There is no technical or administrative reason that the post office could not operate as it does in Japan, as a place to deposit funds (including auto-deposit of Social Security checks), take out cash, etc.  Please note that what I am suggesting is a transparent open market for these services provided by a range of enterprises and institutions. Assemble a marketplace of local credit unions, the post office, enterprises that handle payor-payee transactions such as Dwolla and PayPal, and you have a wide spectrum of choices to suit every need.  As for business loans: you can get small-business loans on PayPal right now. It's called Working Capital, and the borrower is given the total amount due right up front.  As for the commercial paper market: there is no technical reason why a transparent exchange couldn't enable borrowers and owners of capital to set short-term loan rates via transparent bidding with automated software.  The obsolescence of banking includes the Federal Reserve--the ultimate middleman skimming operation. But what about providing liquidity in credit panics? Well, to start with, once the banking sector is gone then the concentrations of risk and the obscuring of risk that go hand in hand with banking also disappear-- the forces that generate panics will have been dispersed. Those forces will have vanished along with the middleman financial sector that created all the risks, speculative excesses and panics. If there were a liquidity crisis, the Treasury could create and lend whatever funds were needed.  But what about manipulating interest rates and other forms of financial repression? Interest rates would be set by millions of borrowers and owners of capital in transparent transactions.  What about all those great investing services offered by big banks and Wall Street? As many have observed, automated index funds outperform 99% of fund managers over 10 year time frames. So Wall Street is also obsolete.  Once we get rid of these obsolete middleman parasites--Wall Street, the banking sector and the Federal Reserve--we have a delightful question to answer: what else can we do with the $1.25 trillion we'll save every year by eliminating these obsolete financial middleman parasites? A lot.   The Nearly Free University and The Emerging Economy: The Revolution in Higher Education...

Joined 2/2001Location: NJThumbs Up: 17I just bought 4 of the Lane 175 seats ( Brown leather bonded with power recline ) at a local furniture store. They look very similar to the Berkline 13175 seats pictured above. I paid $300 per seat plus $59 for white glove delivery of all 4 seats.Several years ago I was shopping for a new Tahoe. I visited several dealerships and a few of them claimed they couldn't drop the price any further because the price was only $100 over dealer cost. They even presented me with official looking documents showing the dealer cost to backup their claims.A few days later my brother informed me that one of his good buddies worked for GM in some type of corporate position overseeing several dealerships a few hours from where we lived. I told his buddy about the dealer prices I was quoted by the dealers and he said every one of em was full of baloney. Turns out the price the dealers claimed was barely above dealer cost was really going to net the dealer $10k in incentives, rebates etc from the manufacturer. Rather then pass along some of the savings the dealers lied about selling at dealer cost so they could ""break even"".Thankfully he was able to send me to a dealer willing to drop his price $8k below every other dealer I had visited. This only happened because I had inside info. Otherwise I would have believed the claims of dealer cost.  Subwoofer needed with floor standing speakers??

spam	" Stevanovich/ShutterstockAs she paged through Viking River Cruises' glossy brochure one recent afternoon, Diane Moskal noticed a new way to save money: If she booked the Waterways of the Tsars itinerary sailing from Moscow to St. Petersburg with something called an e-check, the cruise line promised to knock $100 off the fare.An e-check is an electronic debit to your checking account, and it's billed as a quick, convenient way to pay for your vacation that is ""as easy as providing your credit card number,"" according to Viking.But like any smart traveler, Moskal wasn't content with that explanation. ""I see that the cruise lines advocate consumer savings if you pay by e-check,"" she says. But she also found several complaints online, which made her hesitate. She wondered: Are e-checks safe?As airlines, hotels and cruise lines offer new ways to pay for their products, Moskal's question resonates across the entire travel industry. On several airlines, including American, Southwest and United, you can book a ticket through PayPal. Virgin Galactic made a splash late last year when it announced that it would accept Bitcoin for its spaceflights. One hostel in San Francisco, the Pacific Tradewinds, famously offers a 30 percent discount to guests who pay with the digital currency.While Viking River's e-check option isn't new - it's been available since 2008 - the concerns raised by Moskal and others are. It turns out that there are several important differences between paying by e-check and paying by credit card. And given the popularity of new electronic payment choices, it's a good time to understand how they work.Americans made 22.1 billion electronic payments using options such as e-checks in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers are available, according to a recent Federal Reserve study. The number of transactions grew at an annual rate of 5.1 percent from 2009 to 2012, the Fed reports. By comparison, consumers conducted 26.2 billion credit card transactions in 2012, and those numbers grew at a somewhat faster 7.6 percent annual rate.The benefits to companies are obvious: They avoid paying any fees associated with credit cards and they receive the customer's money right away, deposited directly into their merchant bank. But consumers have an advantage, too, at least according to companies like Viking.""Guests who pay via e-check receive a discount of two percent, which reflects a savings that Viking passes on to the guest by not having to pay a fee to a credit card company,"" says Viking spokesman Ian Jeffries. He says that the company also recommends payment via e-check as an alternative to a credit card so that you can avoid any interest rates or fees that some credit card companies may charge.Viking is hardly alone. One recent study found that a quarter of airlines worldwide offer some form of alternative electronic payment option. As companies try to escape the high merchant fees charged by credit cards, these payment choices are bound to become more common in the near future.""Conventionally, the discounted pay-by-e-check transactions are processed through the traveler's bank, given the customer's bank routing numbers and checking or savings account numbers,"" says Oliver McGee, a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of transportation for technology policy and a professor at Howard University.E-checks come in two basic flavors: Check21 electronic payment processing, which is more flexible but also more expensive, and the more restricted ACH wire deposit payments, which are commonly used for handling direct deposits for employees and for paying bills.As a practical matter, setting up an e-check involves giving the travel company basic bank information, typically gained through the bank's routing numbers, as well as your account number, and authorizing the transaction.But you also sacrifice something when you're paying with an e-check. As with paper checks, once the money is deposited into the company's account, your ability to reverse the charges is limited. Your right to dispute an e-check travel purchase is governed by either the ACH or Check21 terms and conditions as well as the electronic fraud protection conditions of your financial institution.By comparison, a credit card purchase is protected by federal law under the Fair Credit Billing Act, which, among other things, lets you dispute charges for products you didn't accept or that weren't delivered as agreed, and which can quickly fix a billing error.""You have more leeway to dispute a purchase made with a credit card,"" says David Bakke, who edits the personal finance Web siteMoney Crashers .If an e-check booking goes wrong - say, for example, that your cruise line files for bankruptcy protection and you want a refund - you may lose your money. Bakke says that e-checks can be reversed in only three cases: if you didn't authorize the purchase, if the e-check was processed on a date earlier than authorized or if the amount of the processed transaction is different from what was authorized. Otherwise, the money is as good as gone.While complaints about e-checks are rare, grievances with companies over wired money appear to be increasingly common. Not a week seems to go by that someone doesn't ask me to help retrieve money that had been wired to a company or an individual. These transactions are difficult, if not impossible, to undo. Generally, if you're dealing with a small local company or an individual, you can kiss the cash goodbye.If you're having trouble with a business - any business - and you've reached a dead end, maybe we can help.

spam	" They've been pounding the commercials lately, and I thought it was another BS gimmick like quibids, etc. I signed up to give it a shot, and it looks to be a legit and good site. When you buy online, you go to their site, then link to wherever you're going to buy from (and they have a LOT of sites to link to). They pay you a percentage of what you spend. That's it. There's no catch, which really surprised me. I signed up a month ago and got a few dollars deposited in my paypal already. Not much, but it's free money that came back to me. I'm not usually one for wh0ring stuff, but free money is free money. Here's my referral link to sign up.

I know they have an area that they want you post what you are buying, and they get a percentage. I would bet that that's identical to what they use. Facebook, Amazon, and a lot of other sites have links to go buy stuff. I guess that's how they're making more/extra money. Apparently this has been around for quite a while and some genius finally figured out how to cash in while giving money back to the buyer. BRILLIANT!

Who is Behind the Very Generous 'Tips for Jesus'?Thanks to DT.By Alastair Leithead, BBC News, Los Angeles - February 21, 2014http://tinyurl.com/m9kczutA secretive syndicate of super-rich diners have started a trend of leaving lottery-winning tips for bar staff, waiters and waitresses across the US. The lucky recipients are thrilled at the windfall, but is this another sign of the growing chasm between the rich and everyone else in America?Scribbling the phrase ""Tips for Jesus"" alongside outrageous gratuities on credit card receipts, the trend - presumably among the super-rich - has set the internet abuzz with speculation over who the ringleader might be.More than $130,000 (å£78,027) worth of tips are said to have been left in the six months since the mystery handouts began.Pictures of many grinning faces and evidence of their windfalls have been posted on Twitter and Instagram, where #TipsForJesus is not only trending but is unsurprisingly attracting a lot of ""likes"".The movement we started is intended to be agnostic""- Unnamed,""Tips for Jesus"" ringleaderUndercover benefactorsThe rich and mysterious tipper or group of tippers have been leaving giant gratuities in a dozen cities across the US and Mexico, but recently the service staff of Los Angeles have been cashing in.Just last week a waiter at a top Italian restaurant in LA picked up a $6,000 gratuity on a $900 dinner bill, and a fast food server was given a $100 for a $4 milkshake.Two waitresses at an iconic Sunset Boulevard strip club, Jumbo's Clown Room, shared $2,000 in tips on a $272 bill.But the undercover benefactors have also been operating in New York, Arizona, San Francisco and Palo Alto, and it's there where many people think the secret to the lavish spending lies - a Silicon Valley billionaire. Some insider magazines have gone as far as to name former PayPal vice-president Jack Selby as the mystery money man, but he's keeping quiet and those responsible remain out of the public eye.And apparently ""Tips for Jesus"" has nothing to do with religion.Widening wealth gapThe ringleader asked to keep his anonymity in exchange for an interview with the San Francisco Magazine. ""The movement we started is intended to be agnostic,"" he is quoted as saying, suggesting he can't remember exactly how it all began, other than it being last September after a college football game in Michigan.A $3,000 tip on an $87.98 tab, with a photograph posted to Instagram, and ever since then a flurry of local media interest has followed news of the latest big gratuity.The ringleader has ""been fortunate"" in life, the magazine says, adding he and his friends had been big tippers for years - just not this big. Rubber stamps have even been made, and there's a possibility copy-cat tipping is going on - something welcomed by those lucky enough to share in the peculiar redistribution of wealth.Tipping is part of culture in the US, where there are traditionally low wages for serving staff, but this is a curious form of luck-based philanthropy.This is the Council of Love meditation to guide you in anchoring your sacred self in the Divine Mother's Tsunami of Love.

Negative	 Amazon trumps Ebay all day long for selling used gear. The way their dispute process works is simply a lot more genuine without sellers being capable of normally pulling this sort of a stunt. Just be lucky he didn't ship you back a box of dog shit and Ebay/Paypal would still refund him the cash and you'll be out the lens. You'd best be praying that he isn't attempting to scam you as it's so incredibly easy to do using Ebay. Every now and then UPS/FEDEX/ETC are the ones to blame when they mistreat packages in transit. As much as I hate to say it neither of these companies take any care when handling packages. Either way you should completely avoid Ebay for selling high value items. It's a mine field at the best of times. A grumble about eBay and inexperienced shooters

Well, we were denied again and received the same standard vague unapproval email which makes me wonder how we can get better support. I think they believe it is related to e-cigs. The truth is it is not in any way related to e-cigs. Google accepts business with aromatherapy and there are comprable ecommerce stores using Paypal. I am certain there is a way to get approved.

Negative	" Originally Posted by DavidS7 Hello, for a while I've launched my website using the eCommerce Magento, but I am currently migrating to OpenCart since it is easier to use. But before going forward, and make another mistake, I need your help: I've never been satisfied with my website: www.techmake.com - I need eCommerce (shopping cart, catalog, statistics, etc.) but I also need to create content, with something easy to use such as WYSIWYG. - I also want to integrate a Forum, and the login and password of the shopping cart is the same as the forum. - Integrate a blog - etc. Can anyone advice me what should I use? Thank you. I played around with OpenCart last year but dropped it to concentrate on other things. I do remember being able to customise the stylesheet fairly easily and tweaking it a lot. I stuck with basic template. I would be interested in knowing how to set up a commerce system on a local virtual server like WAMP, or anything that simulate the database. I was having to make my OpenCart tweaks live on a test subdomain. I didn't get very far unfortunately because I was only poking around with a checkout system by request of a client for whom I'd already built a website. My bigger challenge was integrating a merchant account, SSL and a payment processor that was ANYTHING but PayPal. The OpenCart community publish a fair few plugins but I remember their forums ( http://forum.opencart.com ) containing lively discussions about which plugins were broken and which were working. Always useful to read that stuff first. The other thing with OpenCart was I never knew how to make it responsive, and as for the blog - I never made it that far! LOL I am now smitten with WordPress so I'll probably be looking to use StudioPress plugins to tackle any commerce system challenges. I'm pretty sure OpenCart is open source and free but if I HAD to use it, I would be looking for a premium version of the software and pay gladly. If there are good developers that can help you, please keep us informed on this thread! I would appreciate knowing your experiences and seeing how we can share tips, advice etc. Edit: Here are some screencast videos by OpenCar t. I seem to remember following these and finding them helpful CMS and eCommerce together?"

Negative	 Quote: : I offered to send him payment via paypal. He declined. This was a done deal but the seller didn't approve of my form of payment and I didn't approve of how he wanted payment so to me that just means the deal is a no go. End of story. So quit being a whiny gash and send a PMO. Lots of people do NOT use PP. Any of my internet friends know Daves Offroad?

Negative	" Travel TechURGENT alternative to skype, for tabletI'm having a nightmare (airline/tripsta took my money but lost my booking so I'm stranded) and need to make lots of international calls.Skype have 'improved' their service again by routing any attempt to buy credit through a partner company in Taiwan, because that's where I was when I opened my account. I don't live there and don't have a Taiwan bank account, so can't use it. I tried opening a new account in New Zealand, but the 'buy credit' button takes me to a blank page. And my girlfriemd's Indonesian account doesn't even include an option to buy credit. So I need another oprion.I tried Tablet Calling app, but paypal tell me they can't process payments to that company. No reason why! I checked and I do have money in paypal, which is the only payment option they offer.What can I install that will allow me to add credit from either paypal or visa card, to make voice calls worldwide?I'm on an Acer Iconia tablet running Android, and also have a cheap Samsung Android phone.  3I ended up just buying a calling card, and asking Tripsta to call me back.Does Google talk allow you to call phone numbers? They make everything so complicated, I don't even know what their service can or can't do. Still looking for an alternative in the long term. Skype customer service told me that as far as they're concerned I am Taiwanese and have to use Taiwan payment systems, which incidentally are only available to Taiwan citizens. Even if I still lived there, I couldn't use their service any more.If a global business can't understand that people move around, it's not really useful for me. Does anyone know of any great services ( of any kind) that don't pigeonhole you because of where you happen to be on that day?  4I found the only ""solution"" to be making sure the account is amply loaded with money before heading out on a trip. You simply can not count on being able to credit more funds to an existing account, or set up a new account with a new provider, while you're on the road. I think this applies no matter who you use.  5difficult to get access to my own phone unless I have my own lodge or hotel etc. but still check if hte hotel charge locally some do. calling cards used in public phones are quite expensive so I just use a simcard or just pay and use their phones in the hotel for these unexpected stuff it cost more but at least it gets the job done. if it was just chatting to people I know myself I juse apps like WeChat, WhatsApp etc ... no need to get their Skype ID you just need their phone number provided you have Internet access.  http://www.magicjack.com for years, and I travel a lot. It gives you a USA or Canada phone number and lets you call any number in the US and Canada for  8An alternative to Skype, in terms of video chatting features could be ooVoo. Video calls are extremely simple to set up and conferences can hold up to 12 participants. For the times you don't need video, you can instant message.ooVoo supports calling to phones but you'll need to purchase ooVoo credits first which is very straightforward.

Positive	" I hate to be a stick in the mud, but they're right. If you use your Dad's PayPal for the transaction that's still illegal because you're underage. You would have to have an adult handle all of the transaction, from emails, to payment, to shipping, ect. Just making sure you know! Glad you're gung ho about it (and congrats on you making a tail!) but just don't go breaking the law. Selling a tail"
Positive	" Oh yes there is! I filed BK in 2006 and I have not been late on a thing since (and never carry a balance). I have Chase Marriott & SWA (10k), CaptialOne Venture (10k), Barclaycard (10k), Amex Platinum, minor cards are Target, Kohl's, NewEgg, PayPal BillMe Later, GE Medical. My two chase cards I got a little over a year ago but had to call in to them when I got the online decline (since then they have been GREAT to me on my CL). CaptialOne was my first subprime card (World Card I think it was) but was upgraded to Venture after 4 years ago after calling into them. They also raised my limit from 4k to 10k on a call too - it took a few phone transfers but they did it on my history only and did not even hard pull my scores! Oh, I have a HSBC Card (10k) but I pretty much hate that card (along with my Barclaycard) - but I guess it is really a CaptialOne card now. Just last Saturday I was approved for my Amex Platinum card - after many tries. This was my ""gold ring"" to get back into the Amex door (since I burned them for ~4k on my BK). They even backdated my membership to 1996 - which I find amazing. TU (from Barclaycard site): 731, EX: 738, EQ: 701 Is there life after BK?"
