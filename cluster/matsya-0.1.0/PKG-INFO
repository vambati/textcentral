        ========
        
        matsya is a collection of unsupervised text mining routines writted in numpy to
        cluster data for [Firefox Input](http://input.mozilla.com). I have generalized
        these routines to work in any general context. As far as I have seen, I have not
        found a co-clustering routine implementing the specific algorithm written in
        here, so this module has *some* novelty.
