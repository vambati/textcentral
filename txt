It wasn't. @carwinb @pierre Paypal is option at Wikileaksstore. Is that 3rd party? @carwinb @pierre Why hasn't @wikileaks tried a @paypal account as Pierre suggested hours ago - and found out for certain? Takes 5 minutes! @carwinb @ramoncreager @pierre interesting to note #PayPal were only 0.8% offline 6-8th Dec..and they're calming nearly $6mil damages.. @carwinb I don't know why @wikileaks claims that PayPal is still blocking, when that stopped in 2011. You have to ask them. @carwinb Indeed. @Pierre makes argument that each Anon == 1000 ppl. and thus DDoS not legit form of protest. What about 1 Paypal exec? @carwinb Wau Holland (main 3rd party funding route) blocked, then 'secretly' unblocked - in-effect: blocked. which is worse? @pierre @PayPal @carwinb hey since pierre will respond to you & not me ask him why he claimed the pp14 did dmg to the customers yet paypal service was fine @carwinb needs $901.00 to get to CA to cover PayPal14 case so far $183 raised. Courage & $$'s get the Truth out https://t.co/jC8ZxXpoFM @carwinb omg hugs... thank you for saying that @paypal_14 @pierre @FreedomofPress @ggreenwald @wikileaks @carwinb shall be glued to the TL #PayPal14 .

I requested to cash out on 8 last month but I still cannot receive anything in paypal. @christryba if any left I can paypal. Follow and dm? @chucktodd @pbaril Email is a protocol, and @PayPal is a service provider. #Bitcoin is more like the former; it is not centrally controlled. @chucktodd Paypal more like pre-email electronic bulletin boards: transaction bottle neck, higher cost, single points of failure, etc. @chucktodd by 'single point of failure', thinking of how Paypal-equivalents have acquiesced to blocking contributions to dissidents, etc.. @chunheepy @inoriluve @diszna gune paypal kot situ.. klau ade prob payment i can help no worries.. but i prefer kr site more haha @chuvaness ate look.

Clicked pay and just got taken back to the last payment stage @penguineurope ...then it FINALLY worked through Paypal the last time! @peterkofod @Thomas_Drake1 @wikileaks @pierre I think PayPal should return the frozen funds first. @petitangel1095 I called paypal customer service today and a friendly irish guy helped me. If everyone was irish on the phone it'd be easier @philhavens good timing, i was about to just cash em in for amazon cred. uh, i guess paypal would be easiest? hows $25 for $28 worth sound? @phontigallo Quiet as kept, if RNC wanted young ppl,they'd make weed legalization as a platform,too.RNC would take EBT donation on paypal. @php_austin That Paypal transaction settles on a network. Dwolla is a network, not a wallet. Dwolla cld easily be used by companies like PP. @pierre "they shouldn't have blocked you in the first place and @wikileaks are talking about the PayPal donation ban. This is a good thing. @pierre 1.) Are you saying that PayPal gave @wikileaks notice that they were not blockaded? 2.) Or are you (cont) http://t.co/gQgJ3pk57S @pierre @FreedomofPress @ggreenwald So, if the entire Internet is confused, I can only recommend PayPal make a public statement. @pierre @carwinb @jaraparilla @wikileaks WL has been *directly raising $$ with Paypal?! This is very confusing and weird. @pierre @carwinb @wikileaks pool your resources on supporting the #PayPal14 since weve now all declared the blockade wrong & (1) @pierre @carwinb Neither us, nor the 3rd parties have ever received notice the PayPal blockade has been lifted. Notified only of blockade. @pierre @carwinb http://t.co/xZ4jZDvwab a statement on PayPal’s website. “We’ve notified the account holder of this action.” @pierre @nicolesandler @wikileaks Are u saying that one can only send money via Paypal to tax deductable organisations? Whom are u kidding? @pierre @nicolesandler So if a parent wants to send money to his/her son studying abroad the kid cannot recieve it via Paypal? @pierre @nicolesandler WTF? Paypal followed its guidlines+/or bowed to pressure form US in blocking donations to WL. @pierre @wikileaks Can #PayPal even produce internal documents from 2011 that show there was a decision made to remove the block? @pierre @wikileaks Did you really just tell people to use PayPal to donate to Wikileaks? Really? @pierre @wikileaks Didn't Assange and others accuse you of blocking payments to them via paypal? @pierre @wikileaks Paypal is a great blessing but a great risk for many nonprofits. @pierre @wikileaks Why didn't #PayPal clarify in 2012 when Freedom of the Press fnd was created to bypass amongst others, PayPal blockade? @pierre @wikileaks You're suggesting that @wikileaks maybe isn't blocked, they just think they are cuz they haven't re-registered paypal? @pierre @wikileaks we'll add +1 to the blocked-by-fbi-front-terrorists score. #Paypal14 too. @pierre Accounts that slip under the radar only to be frozen on discovery are expensive. Only Paypal statement on table is: blockaded. @pierre As far as we are aware the PayPal blockade of WikiLeaks has never been lifted. No direct transactions to WL. You list 3rd parties. @pierre Civil Beat in 2010? Who read that? The Paypal blockade resounded round the world. @BenRachinger @carwinb @pierre FUCK Paypal. @wikileaks take #Bitcoin. https://t.co/f82qrXkzZB Bitcoin donations can be anonymous and cannot be blocked. @pierre I thought PayPal wouldn't process payments to @wikileaks. Did something change? @pierre Nonsense.U can pay for any product u want via Paypal.Alsp pretty sure u can DIRECTLY donate money to any person/charity of ur choice @pierre So, PayPal really didn't want to sanction WL? Correct if wrong, but that runs counter to your editorial today. @carwinb @wikileaks @pierre Thank you for publicly announcing the bloackade has ended for WL. Can we get a public confirmation from @PayPal? @pierre The creation of the Free Press Foundation was in part to do just that - evade the PayPal blockade by being a third party. @pierre Those are 3rd party. Since you are chair of Ebay, perhaps you can communicate more clearly to PayPal what the stakes are. @pierre Well, there's PP 14. According to 1 of their counsel PayPal claimed no damage w SEC, yet PP seeking damages from PP14? @pierre What changed between 2010 and 2011? Why did #Paypal lift the blockade as you claim? @pierre What is this PayPal thing? Is it a little like #Bitcoin but with huge fees and limitations that makes eBay unnecessarily expensive? @pierre dude, that's not paypal though, you linked to freedom of press, they circumvent to donate.. @pierre finally speaks about PayPal 14. sufficient? http://t.co/s35AlXhDvr @wikileaks @ggreenwald @carwinb @pierre from the fucking patent farm ebay director who ran ebay/#paypal14 for us customs/dhs and the faggot cult fbi insider threat bullshit @pierre great so you dropped charges and I don;t have to fly out in the blizzard for court tomorrow? #paypal14 @pierre hey why did you claim that the paypal14 damaged customers by interrupting service when paypal service wasnt disrupted @pierre on DDOS attacks: imagine if one person can have the power of 6000? I think $8.5 billion gives you more power than that. #PayPal14 @pierre the funds going out. what about new donations going in? get a new paypal account, where's old one? @carwinb @jaraparilla @wikileaks @pierre the funds going out. what about new donations going in? go get a new paypal account? but where is the old one? @carwinb @wikileaks @pierre what are you going to do to make @wikileaks donations via PayPal possible again? @pierre will do his best for #PayPal14 if you guys leave GG alone. @pitchrs looks awesome! Surprised to see @braintree there as they were just acquired by @ebay / @PayPal: http://t.co/Uo7c5YI0Ek I may come! @pixeljam Darn Kickstarter - take my money!!! No Paypal?! WTF?!

Lemme know how PayPal is, I might set it up if/when I set up Skype shows. Lolzzzzzz @quinnnorton Are there similar examples of @PayPal politicking? Are you not arguing they must like the KKK? @ggreenwald @wikileaks @pierre @quinnnorton Because there are a sea of shady @PayPal customers.

Paypal hasn't served my pasture well. @tex32us question is WHAT DO YOU HAVE ON YOURS?! :) I can give too! Mine is simple. Paypal/ American Airlines card lol I'm all about family @theBOM324 Hello unni, i'm Jenni from Indonesia i want to buy theBom calendar but how can i pay it? i can't use paypal unni.thank you. @theebolavirus @FiDyGrAnD I can do $210 shipped PayPal @thegame I would like to pledge a donation to the family of the young boy who was gunned down, does the family have a paypal AC setup? @thejustinflynn maybe it did go through because now I have negative PayPal balance @themanofdann PayPal are really shit. I sold my laptop once on eBay, I posted it, seller said it never arrived and they just refunded him. @themanofdann Paypal side with unemployed father of one who was buying the £450 Xbox for his 4 year old son. @therealp0sted @SOFstudios i did too homie i was told up to 24-48 hrs gotta wait for paypal to confirm @thetrainline Why do you charge £1.50 booking fee and an extra 77p if you pay with @PayPal? @thetrin Will do, thank you. There was a bit of a hiccup at the end of the Paypal billing process. @thomasbuckler PayPal is slower than we originally thought they'd be. Probably because we're dealing with larger sums. @thomasgrau second the collected donations is nothing against the amount of money you make with paypal buttons after release or google ads. @thyrazine8 @jaybee238 go na!!

Would you like my paypal email? @transhuman @BiellaColeman Pure chaos. The squirrels came & there was a massive battle for mankind. By the end, the #PayPal14 saved us all. @trevor_dozen talk to me here cux I'm not a member I'm paypal ready u said 120 @trevortimm @f_sthl And why wouldn't you? PayPal didn't tell WL it had been removed. That makes @pierre's op-ed deeply misleading @trevortimm The PayPal blockade bypass was setup in 2012. That's after when @pierre claims the blockade was lifted. @trh_HF @f_sthl @trevortimm I never noticed the questions. Did a WL rep call PayPal and ask them to comment at any time after 2011? @trh_HF @m_cetera "If you have been extrajudicially barred from using Paypal's service, press one or hold the line..." @trh_HF If Pierre says the blockade is lifted, then that's great. We can't confirm anything though, that's up to PayPal. @trickmittens paypals the real criminal @tsbabyz I donated by paypal last week but I've had no confirmation email you received as you said? @tuco1968 some small fees i think lower than paypal @twitcastinglive How do I add money from PayPal (for coins) ?

I mean that donate to wikileaks via paypal tweet was just the most disingenuous thing. @walterglass @trh_HF the conversation about PayPal was just a deliberate, calculated obfuscation. @ward_army01lw it will take me a few days to edit these vids.

I am in a pickle Anyone able to loan me 26.43 via paypal. Will be able to repay 35 dollars Sat ! paypal address =... http://t.co/06adcYfx20 I am inordinately frustrated about PayPal's refusal to send money to another account for free despite me linking my bank account as demanded I am not an attorney- but as an "arguing advocate" my record is peerless, and today was no different. I wish the same for #PayPal14 today. I am utterly disgusted w/ the mis-Tx of "PayPal14" #pp14 I protested in my college days, arrested 2x, pd $150 fines. Protest is American! I believe when you're asked if you understand you always say yes in court, no matter how confusing and jargony everything is. #paypal14 I bet John Lennon would have loved online transactions, 'Imagine all the PayPal...'

If there are no takers by tomorrow, I'll be making a listing on ebay. I accept Paypal. I can't believe I have to look at a giant ad every time I log into paypal now. I don't want to shop ebay, I want to access my f'ing account. I can't pay for my eBAY items. It keeps saying, I've been logged out of @PayPal, even when I just log in. Someone's gonna get strangled. I can't stand paypal 👎 I cannot successfully add my bank account to PayPal. This means that I'm less than a caveman. I check my paypal everyday, hoping for a magical fairy that gives me money I completely forgot about @PayPal's fees. So that's $75 from @eBay and $22 from Paypal? They're the same fucking company! Ridiculous. I could have afforded braces on my cloned T-Rex w/all the mother lickin' eBay and PayPal fees I've paid. I deadass sent him $10 via paypal to make sure his dumbass eats, I'm a keeper I do not want to use "Bill Me Later (a PayPal service)". I don't follow PayPal on Instagram, goddam advertisement I don't know what to do with paypal bc I don't have a credit card. I'm struggling to get to order @Jordanjansen card .

(1/2) @pierre Here is one of Paypal's statements on the blockade https://t.co/d1oeUYGjmT @pierre I do not speak for @wikileaks. But it was a workaround and it worked. Why would they go looking for trouble by approaching PayPal? @pierre Imagine your organisation looked like this after a political blockade http://t.co/oKppZzyBNQ followed by #Paypal14 prosecution. @pierre Insanely great that you are publicly vocal about helping to keep PayPal an open conduit for freedom of financial choice!! @pierre Or this article in the NYTimes by David Carr. Paypal miss that too, eh? http://t.co/CD2vWSLura @pierre Paypal's PR team doesn't read the NYTimes? http://t.co/ouTLBfUP4Z a secret unblock is a blockade, trying to avert being sued. @pierre Perhaps this article Dec 2012 in the NYTimes? Paypal media monitoring team missed that too eh? http://t.co/093BDIIlaJ @pierre chairman of Ebay, owner of @ggreenwald NewCo says PayPal blockade of @wikileaks 'ended' in 2011 - without informing @wikileaks @pierre if @wikileaks "weren't doing anything wrong" then why did PayPal block them? @pierre that article cites #PayPal's blog, link to which is missing (across multi citations): http://t.co/Y8TNuSdTE8 via @marthagroup @pierre that article cites #PayPal's blog, link to which is mysteriously missing (across multi citations): http://t.co/LsJr7ZbzwZ @wikileaks @pierre that's great, but #Paypal "illegal activity" blocking of WHF acc' lost Wls €11,400 per day. will you right this wrong? @wikileaks @pitchdesign @marcymarcy ebay lowers fees for sales that are going to be donated, so paypal might have some different rates @pitchdesign Our org. uses PayPal, but we're looking at other options.
